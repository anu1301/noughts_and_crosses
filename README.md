# Noughts & Crosses

Noughts and Crosses", also called "Tic-tac-toe" or "Hugs and Kisses", is an ancient game that billions of people have played over the course of history. While some experts believe the game dates back to the ancient Egyptians, others believe it evolved from an ancient Roman game called Terni Lapilli.

The modern game is played on a nine-square grid created by drawing lines to create three horizontal rows and three vertical columns. Players alternate marking the squares with Xs and Os, trying to achieve three marks in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
